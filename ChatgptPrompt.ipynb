      "and basic sites on the surface of La 2O3, and lower the reaction energy of CH 4on the surface of hybrid catalysts, which have been revealed by our studies. We now turn to find the reasons why the hybrid Sr –La2O3 nanofibers show an improved catalytic performance and good stability compared to pure La 2O3nanofibers. Firstly, TEM, XRD and theoretical studies confirmed that the lattice struc- ture of La 2O3can be indeed tailored by Sr insertion. Pure La2O3nanofibers used were 20 –30 nm in diameter and several micrometers in length with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2a). 8.6 wt% Sr–La2O3nanofibers used herein with a rough surface were 40–50 nm in diameter and hundreds of nanometers in length (Fig. 2b and 3a). The corresponding EDS spectra shown in the inset of Fig. 2b were direct evidence of the existence of Sr inhybrid nanofibers. The homogeneous distribution of Sr in hybrid nanofibers is presented in the elemental maps (Fig. 3d), which clearly revealed the existence and distributionof Sr, La and O elements in hybrid nanofibers, wherein diﬀerent colors represent di ﬀerent elements (Fig. 3b –d). Unlike the conventional Sr doped La 2O3spherical catalyst, where Sr easily gets leaked from the doped catalyst under high temperature conditions, hybrid Sr –La2O3catalysts are much stable during the OCM reaction and the Sr element is homo-geneously distributed in hybrid nanofibers even after reaction, as shown in Fig. 3e –h. In particular, TG data of the spent Sr–La 2O3catalyst indicated that no coke was formed on hybrid Sr–La2O3nanofibers, verified by no weight loss measured from the spent catalyst (Fig. S4 †). It is of paramount importance to achieve the catalytic materials which can resist sintering andcoking at high temperatures. Moreover, the introduction of Sr widened the lattice fringes of La 2O3nanofibers. In Fig. 2c, the crystal lattice fringes ofLa2O3are \n",
      "0.19, 0.30, 0.31 and 0.33 nm apart, which are in agreement with the dvalue of (110), (101), (002) and (100) lattice planes of hexagonal La 2O3with growth along the (101) direction. For Sr –La2O3nanofibers, the crystal lattice fringes of La2O3are 0.20, 0.30, 0.32 and 0.34 nm apart, which corre- spond to the dvalue of (110), (101), (002) and (100) lattice planes of hexagonal La 2O3. The lattice fringes of (110), (101) and (002) lattice planes broaden after introducing Sr, which is due to the larger ionic radii of Sr (0.118 nm) than La ions (0.1032 nm). XRD studies further corroborated the change of the space lattice of La 2O3nanofibers viathe insertion of Sr ions into the crystal lattice of La 2O3(right panel of Fig. 4). Without Sr inser- tion, the lattice parameters of hexagonal La 2O3are 0.3930 nm (a), 0.3930 nm ( b) and 0.6109 nm ( c), while in hybrid Sr –La2O3, in particular the Sr content is equal to or more than 3.4 wt%, Fig. 3 (a) TEM image of fresh Sr –La2O3nano ﬁbers and (b, c, d) the corresponding elemental maps for La, O and Sr. (e) TEM image of thespent Sr –La 2O3nano ﬁbers and (f, g, h) the corresponding elemental maps for La, O and Sr. Fig. 1 Catalytic performances of pure La 2O3and hybrid Sr –La2O3nano- ﬁbers for OCM reaction: (a) CH 4conversion and (b) C 2yield.

Interestingly, XRD patterns of pure La 2O3and hybrid Sr –La2O3nanofibers showed similar di ﬀraction peaks at 2 θ= 26.11°, 29.96°, 46.08°, and 52.13°, corresponding to the characteristic di ﬀractions of the (100), (101), (110), and (103) planes of La 2O3(JCPDS 05- 0602). It is noted that the black rhombus in the XRD of Fig. 4referred to the La 2O2CO3phase, which cannot be avoided for La2O3to transform into La 2O2CO3in moist air. Red dots in the left panel of Fig. 4 stood for the SrCO 3phases, which might be generated during the calcination of Sr(NO 3)2–La(OH) 3in the air (experimental part in ESI †). Thus these catalysts must be pretreated at 800 °C under N 2for 2 h before the OCM test to remove these impurities. There is no indication of Sr or related oxide phases, suggesting the single component of Sr –La2O3 themselves rather than the mixture of Sr and La 2O3, except for a small amount of SrCO 3and La 2O2CO3. After the reaction, the spent Sr –La2O3showed similar XRD di ﬀractions of fresh catalysts (Fig. S5 †). The change of the La 2O3structure caused viainserting Sr was also confirmed by the DFT + Umethod (the periodic plane wave DFT implementation in the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) code19,20).

      "3. The characteri- zation by CO 2-TPD allowed us to demonstrate the nature of surface strong basic sites on Sr –La2O3nanofibers (Fig. 6). There are three types of basic sites: the weak, medium and strong basic site, which are associated with desorption of CO 2 at the temperatures 100 °C, 300 –600 °C and >600 °C, respect- ively. Among the three distinct basic sites, the strong basic sites are crucial for the OCM process carried out above 600 °C.The addition of Sr, influencing sharply the strength and quan- tity of the base of La 2O3, resulted in the creation of more strong basic sites compared with intermediate basic sites. Forpure La 2O3,m o s tC O 2was desorbed at 300 –600 °C. For 0.8 wt% Sr–La2O3, part of CO 2was desorbed at >600 °C, and most CO2was desorbed at 300 –600 °C. When the Sr content exceeded 3.4 wt% within hybrids, almost all of CO 2was des- orbed at 700 –800 °C. It suggests that the surfaces of La 2O3and 0.8 wt% Sr –La2O3are dominated by medium basic sites, whereas the surface of Sr –La2O3with the Sr content above 3.4 wt% is dominated by strong basic sites. The distinct di ﬀer- ence of basic sites on the surfaces is one of the reasons for theimproved catalysis of hybrid Sr –La 2O3in OCM reaction. The roles played by surface oxygen species are, in addition to surface basic sites, investigated by XPS analyses. The O 1sspectra of samples can be deconvoluted into four peaks corres- ponding to four di ﬀerent oxygen species: superoxide O 2−, carbo- nate CO 32−, peroxide ions O−, and lattice oxygen O2−, shown in Table 1. The electron deficient species such as O 2−and O− on the surface of catalysts, as is well-known, are e ﬀective for the C 2selectivity, while the lattice oxygen O2−is responsible Fig. 4 XRD patterns of La 2O3and Sr –La2O3nano ﬁbers (left panel) and lattice parameters ( a,band c)o fL a 2O3and Sr –La2O3nano ﬁbers (right panel).

      "for complete oxidation to form CO and CO 2.18,22The ratio of the peak intensities of the electron deficient species to latticeoxygen, (O 2−+O−)/O2−, can be calculated using the 80% Gaus- sian –20% Lorentzian peak shape (Fig. S6 †). From the ratio of (O−+O 2−)t oO2−shown in Table 1, 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3nano- fibers have the highest ratio (7.5) and achieved the highest C 2 selectivity among the hybrid catalysts, which is in accordancewith the literature. 18,22 Fig. 7 (curve a) shows the typical La 3d 5/2of pure La 2O3and 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3nanofibers. After the introduction of Sr, the binding energy peak located at 834.3 eV shifted to a lowerbinding energy (833.1 eV), and the energy peak at 837.4 eV shifted to a higher binding energy (837.5 eV), revealing that the electronic properties of La were changed by Sr insertion.Fig. 7b shows that the Sr 3d spectra could be divided into two peaks at the binding energies of 132.1 eV and 133.9 eV, which correspond to SrO and SrCO 3,23suggesting that Sr occurred on the surface of Sr –La2O3in the form of SrO and SrCO 3. The comparison of the structure and energetics of the associative and dissociative adsorption of CH 4on pure and hybrid Sr –La2O3could be made through the DFT study, since the reaction pathway of CH 4on the two catalysts is di ﬃcult to trace. The optimized structures for the CH 4,C H 3, H and co- adsorbed CH 3+ H on Sr –La2O3(101) surfaces are shown in Fig. 8, and distances for H –O and C –O are listed in Table 2. In Fig. 8, CH 3and H are preferable to be adsorbed at the three bonded oxygen atoms near the Sr atom. The corresponding optimized structures for the CH 4,C H 3, H and co-adsorbed CH 3+ H on pure La 2O3(101) surfaces can be obtained from our former work.18The adsorption energies for all the specieson the pure La 2O3surface are all lower than those of the Sr – La2O3surface ( −0.11 vs.−0.12 eV for CH 4,−2.34 vs.−3.54 eV for CH 3, and −3.40 vs.−4.67 eV for H). The interatomic dis- tances between O and H, and O and C on the Sr –La2O3(101) surfaces are all shorter than the pure La 2O3surface (2.23 vs. 2.33 Å for CH 4, 0.96 vs.0.97 Å for H, and 1.39 vs.1.40 Å for CH 3). The same trends are observed in the CH 3+ H co-adsorp- tion, with adsorption ene\n",
      "rgies of −4.54 eV and −6.97 eV, respectively. Thus, the corresponding reaction energies of CH 4 activation on (101) of La 2O3and Sr –La2O3are 0.30 and −2.13 eV, respectively. According to the Brønsted –Evans –Polanyi relationship, such a significant di ﬀerence (2.43 eV) in reaction energy suggests that methane activation is preferred over the (101) surface of Sr –La2O3, even when taking the actual reaction conditions into account. Conclusions In summary, hybrid Sr –La2O3nanofibers enhanced signifi- cantly conversion of CH 4and the selectivity of C 2hydrocar- bons. In particular, for the 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3hybrid catalyst, the initial ignition temperature of methane was about 500 °C,and methane conversion and C 2selectivity were up to ∼35% and 47% at 500 °C, respectively. The synergistic e ﬀects of material properties of individual Sr and La 2O3optimized inde- pendently, i.e.the lattice structure and electronic properties of La2O3are tailored by Sr, surface basic sites of La 2O3areTable 1 Curve- ﬁtting results from XPS data CatalystsO 1s binding energies (eV) (O−+O 2−)/O2−O2−O−CO32−O2− La2O3 529.1 531.5 532.7 534.6 5.1 0.8 wt% Sr –La2O3 529.1 531.0 532.1 533.6 3.4 3.4 wt% Sr –La2O3 528.7 531.1 531.9 534.0 4.3 6.0 wt% Sr –La2O3 528.7 531.1 532.0 533.9 4.6 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3 529.1 531.6 533.0 534.6 7.5 12.1 wt% Sr –La2O3528.9 531.1 532.1 533.4 5.1 Fig. 7 (a) XPS La 3d 5/2spectra of La 2O3and 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3nano ﬁ- bers and (b) Sr 3d XPS spectra of 8.6 wt% Sr –La2O3.
